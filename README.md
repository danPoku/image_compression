### Image and Video Compression Script

## img_compress.py
This script compresses all image files (.jpg and .png only) in a 
folder and its subfolders and saves them in a separate folder. 
It avoids recompressing previously compressed files.

## vid_compress.py
This script compresses all video files (.mp4) in a folder and its subfolders.
